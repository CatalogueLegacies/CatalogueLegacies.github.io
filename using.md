# Using Curatorial Voice

## 18 June 2019, Sussex Humanities Lab, University of Sussex

**[REGISTRATION OPEN](https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/using-curatorial-voice-tickets-60298977866)**

______
### Overview

**'Curatorial Voice: legacy descriptions of art objects and their contemporary uses'** is a 12-month project that explores how new knowledge about the curation and the content of image collections can be generated through computer-assisted analysis of curatorial art descriptions. Our case study is a [catalogue of 1.5 million words](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalogue_of_Political_and_Personal_Satires_Preserved_in_the_Department_of_Prints_and_Drawings_in_the_British_Museum) written by the historian [M. Dorothy George](https://doi.org/10.1093/ref:odnb/45657) between 1935 and 1954 to describe 12,552 Georgian satirical prints, which we use as a starting point to examine descriptions of art objects more broadly.

**'Using Curatorial Voice'** is a one-day workshop that brings together cultural heritage professionals in digital/technical roles, digital humanitsts, curators, art historians, and information professionals to reflect on the role of computational text analysis of image descriptions, along with image analysis, as a basis for exploring new types of access to image collections. Talks will explore:

- The use of text analytics or natural language processing in a galleries, libraries, archives and museums context.
- Experiments with computer vision to analyse/index image content.
- Applications of IIIF.
- The use/repurposing of legacy catalogues.

We are delighted to welcome speakers from the Courtauld Institute of Art, Paul Mellon Centre for Studies in British Art, Science Museum, University of Edinburgh, University of Glasgow, and Wellcome Collection. More speakers will be confirmed soon.

**'Using Curatorial Voice'** is the second of two events funded under the [British Academy](https://www.britac.ac.uk/) [Digital Research in the Humanities Grants](https://www.britac.ac.uk/ba-jisc-digital-research-in-the-humanities) scheme. The project is live between 1 September 2018 and 31 August 2019.
