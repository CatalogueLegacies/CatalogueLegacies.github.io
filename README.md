## Legacies of Catalogue Descriptions and Curatorial Voice: Opportunities for Digital Scholarship

This 12-month project will develop a platform for a transformational impact in digital scholarship within cultural institutions by opening up new and important directions for computational, critical, and curatorial analysis of collection catalogues. Extensive digital and digitised sets of curatorial descriptions from legacy catalogues are increasingly available. We seek to realise their potential as valuable resources for cross-disciplinary research into curatorial practice, and for enhancing access to and analysis of collections at scale.

Our pilot research will investigate the temporal and spatial legacy of a landmark catalogue: the 1.1 million word British Museum '[Catalogue of Political and Personal Satires](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalogue_of_Political_and_Personal_Satires_Preserved_in_the_Department_of_Prints_and_Drawings_in_the_British_Museum)', which is the basis of related catalogue data at the Lewis Walpole Library and the British Library. Alongside this research we will:

- Demonstrate how methods combining corpus linguistic and archival research can be used to produce an empirical account of curatorial "voice" across a large catalogue.
- Ask questions about the enduring legacies of curatorial labour, methods for defining and highlighting those legacies, and the role of digital scholarship in responding to the ways in which legacy descriptions work against contemporary ambitions of cultural institutions.
- Develop sectoral capability in digital scholarship through co-produced training materials and reports, proofs-of-concept for changing how legacy descriptions are presented to diverse publics, and releases of transparent code, data, and methods.

### People

*Legacies of Catalogue Descriptions* is a collaboration between the **[Sussex Humanities Lab](http://www.sussex.ac.uk/shl/)**, the **[British Library](https://www.bl.uk/)**, and **[Yale University Library](https://web.library.yale.edu/)**.

The project is led by **[James Baker](http://www.sussex.ac.uk/profiles/371022)**, Senior Lecturer in Digital History and Archives at the [School of History, Art History and Philosophy](http://www.sussex.ac.uk/hahp/), [University of Sussex](http://www.sussex.ac.uk/). James has a background in the history of the printed image, archival theory, art history, and computational analysis. He is author of *The Business of Satirical Prints in Late-Georgian England* ([2017](https://www.palgrave.com/de/book/9783319499888)), the first monograph on the infrastructure of the satirical print trade circa 1770-1830, and led the British Academy funded *[Curatorial Voice](https://github.com/CuratorialVoice)* project.

The project Co-Investigator is **[Rossitza Atanassova](https://www.bl.uk/people/experts/rossitza-atanassova)**. Rossitza is a Digital Curator (Digitisation) in the [British Library](https://www.bl.uk/)'s [Digital Scholarship Department](https://www.bl.uk/subjects/digital-scholarship) with expertise in the creation and exploitation of digitised content, and experience working on multi-partner international projects. She has a research background in Classics and several years of experience as rare books librarian working with the Library’s 19th-century British printed collections.

**[Andrew Salway](http://www.bbrel.co.uk/)** is a Research Fellow in Digital Humanities at the [School of Media, Film and Music](http://www.sussex.ac.uk/mfm/), [University of Sussex](http://www.sussex.ac.uk/). Andrew has 20 years’ experience of digital text mining and corpus linguistic methods in humanities research, and of project management. He previously applied corpus linguistic techniques to analyse the informational content of audio description (Salway, [2007](http://www.bbrel.co.uk/pdfs/Pre-edited%20version%20Audio%20Description%20a%20Corpus-based%20Analysis.pdf)) and co-developed a generalized system of image-text relations (Martinec and Salway, [2005](http://www.bbrel.co.uk/pdfs/06Martinec-Salway.pdf)).

**[Cynthia Roman](https://walpole.library.yale.edu/people/cynthia-roman)** is Curator Prints, Drawings, & Paintings at the [Lewis Walpole Library](https://walpole.library.yale.edu/), a unit of Yale University Library, and a leading expert in long-eighteenth century British visual satire, including the 2016 volume [*Hogarth’s Legacy*](https://www.worldcat.org/title/hogarths-legacy/oclc/952075179&referer=brief_results).

### Events

Over the course of the project, we will run two capability building workshops and a partnership development workshop. Contact **[James](http://www.sussex.ac.uk/profiles/371022)** for more information.

> **Catalogue Descriptions and Curatorial Voice: analysis + practice (11 May 2020, British Library)**

> In this workshop we will explore how to use computational analysis to determine the linguistic 'features' of legacy catalogue descriptions, and the practical applications of these methods in cataloguing and curatorial practice.

> *More details soon! To hold a place at this free event, please contact [James](http://www.sussex.ac.uk/profiles/371022)*
