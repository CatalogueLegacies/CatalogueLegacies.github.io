# Computational Analysis of Catalogue Data: ad hoc training

## 3 & 9 July 2020

______
### Overview

Each standalone session will provide instruction in using [AntConc](http://www.laurenceanthony.net/software/antconc/) and approaches from computational linguistics for the purposes of examining catalogue data to enable important catalogue related work. In the sessions (delivered in a '[Carpentries](https://carpentries.org/)' style) we will work through one component of our in-development training materials, and seek feedback in order to better understand the needs of community and further develop our training offer.

If you'd like to attend one of these two training events, please contact [James](http://www.sussex.ac.uk/profiles/371022)*
