# Computational Analysis of Catalogue Data

## 16 December 2020

______
### Overview

This standalone session will provide instruction in using [AntConc](http://www.laurenceanthony.net/software/antconc/) and approaches from computational linguistics for the purposes of examining catalogue data to enable important catalogue related work. In the session (delivered in a '[Carpentries](https://carpentries.org/)' style) we will work through two component of our in-development training materials, and seek feedback in order to better understand the needs of community and further develop our training offer.

*If you'd like to attend one of these training events, please contact [James](http://www.sussex.ac.uk/profiles/371022) to book your free place. This is essential as numbers are capped at 30.*
