# Defining Curatorial Voice

## 26-27 February 2018, Sussex Humanities Lab, University of Sussex

______
### Overview

**'Curatorial Voice: legacy descriptions of art objects and their contemporary uses'** is a 12-month project that explores how new knowledge about the curation and the content of image collections can be generated through computer-assisted analysis of curatorial art descriptions. Our case study is a [catalogue of 1.5 million words](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalogue_of_Political_and_Personal_Satires_Preserved_in_the_Department_of_Prints_and_Drawings_in_the_British_Museum) written by the historian [M. Dorothy George](https://doi.org/10.1093/ref:odnb/45657) between 1935 and 1954 to describe 12,552 Georgian satirical prints, which we use as a starting point to examine descriptions of art objects more broadly.

**'Defining Curatorial Voice'** is a two-day workshop that brings together curators, art historians, and information professionals to reflect on the role of curatorial voice in the collections that they work with, to evaluate our corpus linguistic methods for uncovering curatorial voice, and to suggest other collections on which to test our approach.

We are delighted to welcome attendees from the British Library, Museum of London, National Archives, Paul Mellon Centre for Studies in British Art, Science Musuem, University College London, and University of Edinburgh. Spaces are limited. If you'd like to join us, please email [james.baker@sussex.ac.uk](mailto:james.baker@sussex.ac.uk).

**'Defining Curatorial Voice'** is the first of two events funded under the [British Academy](https://www.britac.ac.uk/) [Digital Research in the Humanities Grants](https://www.britac.ac.uk/ba-jisc-digital-research-in-the-humanities) scheme. The project is live between 1 September 2018 and 31 August 2019).
